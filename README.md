# Emerald AI 3.0 :electron:
## Repository for implementing Emerald AI with Hurricane VR

### **26 January 2023**

Today We started working on Emerald AI integration with Hurricane VR for our upcoming VR multiplayer title, Hexagonia.

The game will involve a two-tier system, whereby the player will have to switch between the roles of a base builder, which will be a more relaxed birds eye experience and that of a defender which will carry the player to the "trenches" of combat on the map in 1st person mode.

As part of the initial work, We are adding different animations to the soldiers that will attack and defend the other players on the map, which the player will be fighting alongside in the "defender" mode. 

Next work will involve utilizing Emerald AI to make these two soldiers find and attack each other on their random patrols.

We installed Emerald AI and setup two soldiers, one male and one female with different factions that are set as enemies. All the combat and movement attacks, the needed behaviors as well as the navmesh setup is in place. However, We cannot get them to fight yet :)

We will have to figure out what is causing them not to see / engage with each other.

Emerald AI 3.0 is now implemented correctly. Posting 1v1 and 3v3 combat scenario videos below:
